Learning, as we know, is a two-way process. One has to listen to what the educator has to say and ask questions to clarify his doubt. Currently, students do not clarify their doubts because of **fear**, **shyness** or **embarrassment**. Even when a lecturer tries to hold an interactive lesson, students do not take part actively.

Fragen is a real-time Q&A platform for students and lecturer to communicate effectively. With Fragen, students always has the choice of asking and answering questions anonymously.
